# boiler-definition-library

A javascript template project to act as a boilerplate to understand Typescript compilation

In order to test, you have to:

1- Go to the package folder and run `npm link`

2- Go to consumer folder and run `npm link "librarytest"`

In this way we are going to make a relationship between the package and the consumer witout publishing our package to npm.
